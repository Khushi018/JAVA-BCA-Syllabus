Java Servlets are server-side Java components that allow dynamic generation of HTML pages, handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic web pages. They provide a platform-independent, secure and efficient way of creating web applications. Servlets run on a web server, receiving requests from clients (typically web browsers) and returning responses back to the clients.

Servlets are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform, and they are used for building robust and scalable web applications. Servlets are well suited for handling dynamic requests that require the processing of data and the generation of HTML content. They can interact with databases, access APIs, and perform complex operations, making them ideal for web applications that require server-side processing.

The main advantage of servlets is that they are platform-independent and can run on any web server that supports the Servlet API. They are also designed to work with Java, making it easier to develop web applications that can be used on any platform.

Servlets are written in Java, making them easy to maintain and upgrade, and they are also highly secure. Java provides built-in security features such as access control, encryption, and data validation that can be used to secure web applications.

In summary, Java Servlets are a powerful and efficient way of building dynamic web applications that can run on any platform. They are secure, platform-independent, and easy to maintain, making them a popular choice for web developers
